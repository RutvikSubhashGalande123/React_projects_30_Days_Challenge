# 30 Days React Project Challenge

Welcome to my 30 Days React Project Challenge! Over the next 30 days, I will be building and uploading various React projects to this repository. Each day will feature a new project that showcases different aspects of React development.


## Introduction

The purpose of this challenge is to improve my skills in React development by building a new project every day. Each project will focus on different features and concepts in React, from basic components to advanced state management and hooks.

## Projects

## Below is a list of the projects completed each day:
## Day 1:
Project Name: Password Validator
Description: This project is a tool that evaluates the strength of a password entered by the user.
Project Name: Counter
Description: This is a simple project that allows the user to increase or decrease a count or number.
## Subsequent days (2-29):
More projects will follow, with their respective names and descriptions.
## Day 30:
Details about the project on day 30 are not provided.
I will update this table daily with the name and description of each new project.
